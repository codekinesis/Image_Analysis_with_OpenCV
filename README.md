# image_analyzer
An image analyzer that utilizes OpenCV to detect edges, contours and corners in an image.

This project utilizes OpenCV, an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library, to perform various image analysis tasks such as edge detection, contour detection, and corner detection. These tasks can be useful in various applications including object recognition, image segmentation, and feature extraction.
Features

    Edge detection using Canny edge detector algorithm
    Contour detection to identify the outlines of objects in the image
    Corner detection using the Harris corner detector algorithm

Requirements

    Python 3.x
    OpenCV (cv2) library
    NumPy
